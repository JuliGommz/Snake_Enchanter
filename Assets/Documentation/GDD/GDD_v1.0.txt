Snake Enchanter – GDD v1.0 (Draft)
Version: 1.0 (Grobkonzept) – This document will evolve during development. Sections marked [MAY CHANGE] are expected to be refined or adapted.

1. Project Frame
1.1 Academic Context
Thema: B – Eigenständiges 2D- oder 3D-Spiel mit klarer Kernmechanik
​

Engine: Unity (3D)
​

Platform: Windows, school laptops, stable 60 FPS, 1920x1080 + ultrawide support
​

Team: Solo

Duration: 21.01.2026 – 27.02.2026
​

Implications of Theme B:

Focus on one clear core mechanic (no feature soup).
​

Deliver a playable, completed prototype with clear win and loss conditions.
​

At least one full gameplay loop: Start → Play → End.
​

Game/round statistics stored in a database via HTTP/JSON API.
​

Structured code and clean project organization expected and graded.
​

Implement one Wahlinhalt: here: “Verschiedene Modi – mind. 2 Modi” (Simple & Advanced mode).
​

2. High-Level Concept
2.1 Elevator Pitch
In Snake Enchanter, the player is an adventurer trapped in a collapsed ancient ruin and must use magical melodies to command snakes blocking the only escape: a distant window. Playing the correct tune makes snakes move, sleep, or attack each other, opening a path; mistakes provoke attacks and cost hearts. The player must reach the exit with limited lives – and, in Advanced mode, master an additional tune discovered mid-level.

2.2 Core Fantasy
You are not a warrior; your power is music.

The ruins are unstable; snakes are both danger and tool.

You rehearse melodies and then apply them tactically to survive.

2.3 Target Audience
Age 16+, casual-to-mid-core players, no specific genre experience required.
​

Should understand goal and controls within 30–60 seconds.

2.4 Project Goals (Theme B Alignment)
Deliver a clear, understandable core mechanic (snake command via melodies).
​

Provide a short, replayable experience (5–8 minutes per run).

Implement two modes (Simple, Advanced) from same core level and systems.
​

Integrate database-backed stats to reflect player performance across runs.
​

Support a highly readable, trailer-friendly experience for presentation and Gamescom context.
​

3. Game Structure
3.1 Game Loop
Global loop:

Main Menu → Mode selection (Simple / Advanced).

Brief intro (camera + on-screen hints).

Core gameplay: move through ruin, charm snakes, avoid damage.

Reach window (win) or lose all hearts (lose) or (Advanced) time runs out.

Show result screen (stats) + send stats to backend.

Option: Restart same mode or return to menu.

3.2 Session Length
Target: 5–8 minutes per run (both modes).

Balanced to allow several attempts in a classroom session.

3.3 Modes (Wahlinhalt – 2 Modi)
Mode 1 – Simple Escape

All 3 core tunes available from start.

No global timer.

Snakes slower and less aggressive.

Objective: Reach the window with ≥1 heart.

Mode 2 – Advanced Escape

All 3 core tunes from start.

Hidden scroll unlocks 4th tune mid-level (optional but rewarded).

Global collapse timer (e.g., 8 minutes) counts down.

Snakes patrol faster and react quicker.

Objective:

Base: Reach the window before time runs out and with ≥1 heart.

Bonus: Unlock 4th tune and use it at least once (for higher score/achievement).

[MAY CHANGE]

Exact timer duration and aggression values will be tuned during playtesting.

4th tune effect may be simplified or changed if too complex to communicate.



4. Core Gameplay & Mechanics
4.1 Player Abilities
Movement:

Free 3D movement using WASD.

Mouse controls camera orientation (third-person follow camera).

View:

Third-person follow camera behind/above the character.

Interaction:

Trigger tune casting when inside a defined “command range” of a target snake.

Simple interaction prompts (e.g., “Hold 1 to cast Move Tune”).

4.2 Tune System (Kernmechanik)
Concept:
Each tune is mapped to a single key; holding the key for ~1 second plays a short melody and triggers a specific snake behavior, if the snake is in range and receptive.

Tunes (Mode 1 & 2):

Tune 1 – Move Command

Input: Hold Key 1.

Effect: Targeted snake moves to a predefined safe position (e.g., away from path).

Primary use: Clear blocking snakes to open passage.

Tune 2 – Sleep Command

Input: Hold Key 2.

Effect: Snake coils up, becomes passive, collision reduced or removed so player can pass.

Primary use: Make aggressive snakes safe to walk past.

Tune 3 – Attack Command

Input: Hold Key 3.

Effect: Target snake lunges at the nearest other snake, potentially removing both as threats.

Primary use: Manage groups of snakes without passing through them.

Advanced Mode – Additional Tune:

Tune 4 – [Working Name: “Freeze All”] [MAY CHANGE]

Input: Hold Key 4 (unlocked by scroll).

Effect: Temporarily freezes all snakes in a radius (stops movement, disables attacks).

Primary use: High-impact panic button in advanced puzzles.

Failure Feedback:

If the wrong tune is used on a snake (or used in the wrong context):

Snake attacks: Player loses 1 heart.

Clear visual + audio feedback (e.g., red flash, hiss, sharp sound).

[MAY CHANGE]

Exact mapping of tunes to effects and required snake states may be simplified further if teaching cost is too high in early playtests.

4.3 Health & Failure
Health System:

Player has 3 hearts.

Taking damage (snake bite, potentially environmental hazards) removes one heart.

At 0 hearts, the player dies and the run ends (lose screen).

Damage Sources:

Wrong tune on snake → counter-attack.

Touching aggressive snakes.

Optional: Environmental damage (falling debris) [MAY CHANGE].

4.4 Win & Lose Conditions
Win (both modes):

Reach the window exit trigger with ≥1 heart.

Advanced mode: Optionally with 4th tune unlocked for a better score/rating.

Lose (both modes):

Health reaches 0 hearts.

Advanced mode: Timer reaches 0 (ruin collapse).

5. World, Level & Progression
5.1 Setting & Tone
Setting:

Interior of an ancient ruined temple or fortress, partially collapsed.

Environment: stone corridors, broken pillars, fallen debris, dim light shafts from above.

Tone:

Mysterious, slightly tense but not horror.

Focus on cleverness and control rather than panic.

5.2 Level Structure
Single handcrafted level reused for both modes, with variation through rules (timer, aggression, optional tune).

Rough Area Flow:

Start Area – Tutorial

Safe entry zone.

Introduces movement and camera.

Teaches tune 1 (Move) with a simple, low-risk puzzle.

Area 1 – Simple Blockade

1–2 snakes blocking the path.

Player uses Move or Sleep tunes to clear path.

Area 2 – Mixed Behavior

Combination of blocking and patrolling snakes.

Requires decisions between Move and Sleep.

Maybe one optional use of Attack to remove extra risk.

Area 3 – Aggressive Encounter

An aggressive snake patrolling a narrow corridor.

Encourages use of Sleep or Attack tunes under pressure.

Area 4 – Hidden Alcove (Advanced Only)

Optional side path containing scroll unlocking Tune 4.

Accessible only if player solves a small positioning puzzle.

Area 5 – Finale

3+ snakes in a layered layout near the window.

Intended to require combined usage of all tunes.

Highly visible exit with light beam.

[MAY CHANGE]

Number of areas and specific snake placements will be refined during level iteration.

Advanced mode might adjust snake layouts slightly if necessary.

6. Controls & UX
6.1 Controls (Keyboard & Mouse)
Movement: WASD

Camera: Mouse move (third-person orbit/follow)

Tunes:

Tune 1: Key 1

6.2 UI Elements
Main HUD:

Hearts (3 icons) at top-left.

Current mode label (“Simple Escape” / “Advanced Escape”).

Advanced mode: Timer at top-center.

Tune Feedback:

On screen: small icons or text labels for each tune (1–4) with short description (e.g., Move, Sleep, Attack, Freeze).

When holding tune key:

Progress circle or bar indicating casting time.

Musical note particles.

Snake Feedback:

Visual VFX when a tune affects a snake (color tint, glow, animation).

Clear difference between success (green/blue effect) and failure (red flash).

7. Technical & Data
7.1 Engine & Performance
Unity 3D project.

Third-person character controller (custom or based on starter assets).

Target: 60 FPS on school laptops, minimal overdraw and complex shaders.

7.2 Data & Backend Requirements
As required for all themes (DB + HTTP/JSON).
​

Session Data Stored per Run:

sessionId (UUID)

completionTime (int, seconds)

objectivesCompleted (int, snakes successfully commanded or key events completed)

attempts (int, total attempts by this player/session – simple counter)

modeType (string: "simple" or "advanced")

success (bool: true if reached exit, false otherwise)

timestamp (datetime, ISO 8601)

fourthTuneUnlocked (bool, advanced mode only)

heartsRemaining (int, 0–3)

API Expectations:

POST /api/game-session – store session stats (JSON body).

GET /api/leaderboard?mode=simple – top results for simple mode.

GET /api/leaderboard?mode=advanced – top results for advanced mode.

[MAY CHANGE]

Exact endpoint naming and additional stats may be extended depending on backend constraints or teacher feedback.

8. Assets & Audio
8.1 Visual Assets
Snakes: Toon Snakes Pack (Unity Asset Store) – 3D animated snakes used for all snake entities.

Environment:

Ruin/temple modular assets or ProBuilder-based geometry.

Stone materials, rubble, simple props (pillars, broken walls).

Player:

Simple adventurer model (3D, biped), ideally with walk/run animation.

Fallback: Capsule with basic animation for early prototype.

[MAY CHANGE]

Exact environment asset packs may be swapped based on performance and style.

8.2 Audio
Music:

Ambient ruins background track (generated with Suno.ai or similar).

Optional tension layer in Advanced mode (added when timer < X minutes).

Sound Effects:

Flute melodies for each tune (4 unique audio clips).

Snake hiss/attack sounds.

Stone crumble ambient SFX.

UI sounds (success chime, error beep, button clicks).

All audio must be free/licensed for use and properly credited.
​

9. Risks & Open Questions
9.1 Design Risks
Teaching cost:

3–4 tunes plus health and mode differences could overwhelm players.

Mitigation: Very gentle tutorial ramp and clear on-screen prompts.

Complexity of snake behaviors:

Multi-state snakes (idle, blocking, patrolling, aggressive, charmed) can be complex to debug.

Mitigation: Start with minimal states and build up only if needed.

9.2 Open Questions / [MAY CHANGE]
Should some tunes only work on specific snake types (e.g., Attack only on aggressive snakes)?

Should 4th tune be mandatory for Advanced win, or only a bonus?

Do we need additional environmental hazards to create more variety, or are snakes alone enough?

These will be answered during early playtests and GDD v2 iteration.
