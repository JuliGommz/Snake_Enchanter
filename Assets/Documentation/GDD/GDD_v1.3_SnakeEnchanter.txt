====================================================================

2. High-Level Concept

2.1 Elevator Pitch

In Snake Enchanter, the player is a wounded warrior trapped in a collapsed ancient ruin, racing against failing health to reach the only escape: a distant window. Unable to fight in their weakened state, the warrior uses discovered magical melodies to command snakes—moving them aside, lulling them to sleep, or redirecting them toward other threats. Each successful melody restores health, but timing is critical: hold the key too briefly and the charm fails, causing the snake to attack; hold too long and control slips away. Time is the enemy—health depletes continuously as the warrior weakens, and in Advanced mode, a dynamic collapse timer adapts to health levels, creating mounting pressure.

2.2 Core Fantasy

The player is a warrior, but not in fighting condition.
Music becomes the weapon when physical strength fails.
The ruins are unstable; snakes are both danger and tool.
Every second counts—the warrior is injured and weakening.
Skillful command—precise timing—extends survival; mistakes are costly.

2.3 Target Audience

Age 16+, casual-to-mid-core players, no specific genre experience required.
Should understand goal and controls within 30–60 seconds.

2.4 Project Goals (Theme B Alignment)

• Deliver a clear, understandable core mechanic (tune-based snake command with timing skill).
• Provide a short, replayable experience (5–8 minutes per run).
• Implement two modes (Simple, Advanced) from same core level and systems.
• Integrate database-backed stats to reflect player performance.
• Support a highly readable, trailer-friendly experience.

====================================================================

3. Game Structure

3.1 Game Loop

1. Main Menu → Mode selection (Simple / Advanced).
2. Brief intro (camera + on-screen hints).
3. Core gameplay: move through ruin, charm snakes, manage health depletion.
4. Health management:
   a. Health drains passively over time (wounded warrior).
   b. Successful tune casts restore HP (motivational boost).
   c. Snake attacks deal HP damage.
5. Reach window (win) or health reaches 0 (lose) or (Advanced) dynamic timer expires.
6. Show result screen (stats) + send stats to backend.
7. Option: Restart same mode or return to menu.

3.2 Session Length

Target: 5–8 minutes per run (both modes).
Health drain rates calibrated to this target duration.

3.3 Modes (Wahlinhalt – 2 Modi)

Mode 1 – Simple Escape
• All 3 core tunes available from start.
• Slower passive health drain.
• Snakes slower and less aggressive.
• Longer tune-hold windows (easier timing).
• No additional timer pressure.
• Objective: Reach the window with HP > 0.

Mode 2 – Advanced Escape
• All 3 core tunes from start.
• Hidden scroll unlocks 4th tune mid-level (optional but rewarded).
• Faster passive health drain (15% faster than Simple).
• Stricter tune-hold timing windows (more difficult).
• Dynamic collapse timer linked to HP percentage.
• Snakes patrol faster and react quicker.
• Objective: Reach window before timer expires with HP > 0; bonus for unlocking Tune 4.

====================================================================

4. Core Gameplay & Mechanics

4.1 Player Abilities

Movement: Free 3D movement using WASD.
Camera: Third-person follow camera behind/above the character.
Interaction: Trigger tune casting when inside "command range" of a target snake.

4.2 Tune System (Kernmechanik) – Timing-Based Control

Core Mechanic:
Each tune is mapped to a single key (1, 2, 3, 4 – not Numpad). Player must hold the key for a precise duration to successfully charm a snake. Timing is critical: too short = charm fails (snake attacks); too long = loss of control (snake stops obeying).

Tune Duration & Timing:

Total tune duration: 5–12 seconds (variable, determined by tune type and mode difficulty).
• Tune 1 (Move): 5–8 seconds.
• Tune 2 (Sleep): 6–10 seconds.
• Tune 3 (Attack): 7–12 seconds (scales with target distance).
• Tune 4 (Freeze): 8–12 seconds (Advanced mode only).

Visual Timing Cue:
• Subtle UI indicator (progress ring or meter) near player or snake, visible but not prominent.
• Player must release key when visual cue completes.
• Cue fills smoothly from 0–100% during the hold duration.
• Color progression: Green (start) → Yellow (mid) → Green (success window) → Red (over-hold = fail).

Audio Feedback:
• Melody plays continuously during hold, rising in pitch/intensity.
• Success: Melody resolves with uplifting chime + snake responds.
• Failure (too short): Melody cuts off sharply with discord.
• Failure (too long): Melody distorts and warps with warning tone.

Failure Consequences:

If key is released too early (before success window):
• Charm fails; melody incomplete.
• Snake plays aggressive animation and executes bite attack.
• Player takes HP damage (amount subject to balancing).
• Time is lost (player wasted effort, clock continues).

If key is held too long (past success window):
• Charm breaks; snake loses enchantment mid-cast.
• Snake plays aggressive animation and executes bite attack.
• Player takes HP damage.
• Time is lost.

Health Restoration:
• Only triggered upon successful tune completion (within correct timing window).
• Visual: Green particle burst, floating restoration text, health bar glow.
• Audio: Uplifting chime confirmation.

4.3 Tunes (Kernmechanik Detail)

Tune 1 – Move Command
• Key: 1
• Duration: 5–8 seconds (Simple) / 6–8 seconds (Advanced).
• Effect: Targeted snake moves away from the path to a safe zone.
• Primary use: Clear blocking snakes to open routes.
• On success: Snake relocates, player health restored (+X HP).
• Visual cue: Ring meter near snake showing timing window.

Tune 2 – Sleep Command
• Key: 2
• Duration: 6–10 seconds (Simple) / 7–10 seconds (Advanced).
• Effect: Snake coils up, becomes fully passive, collision disabled.
• Primary use: Neutralize aggressive snakes safely.
• Persistence: Sleeping snakes remain asleep until player passes or timer expires (varies by mode).
• Critical for passage: Player MUST put snakes to sleep to pass unhindered. Otherwise, snakes attack when player moves near, even if not directly blocking the path.
• On success: Snake sleeps peacefully, player health restored (+X HP).
• Visual cue: Meter near snake showing timing window.

Tune 3 – Attack Command
• Key: 3
• Duration: 7–12 seconds (scales with target distance). Simple mode: shorter; Advanced mode: longer.
• Effect: Target snake attacks the nearest living enemy creature.
• Pressure mechanic: If player releases key before snake finishes attack, snake stops attacking and may turn on player.
• In range: If player is within snake attack range while commanding, snake may attack player instead of target.
• On success (snake completes attack): Player health restored (+X HP).
• On failure (early release): Snake stops attack, may engage player; no HP restoration.
• Visual cue: Meter near snake, adapting dynamically as distance to target changes.

Advanced Mode – Tune 4 – Freeze Command
• Key: 4
• Duration: 8–12 seconds.
• Effect: Temporarily freezes all living creatures except player within a radius.
• Hold duration determines freeze duration and radius size (longer hold = larger freeze effect).
• Emergency use: High-impact tool for complex encounters.
• On success: All nearby creatures frozen, player health restored (+X HP).
• Visual cue: Ring meter showing hold duration and freeze radius preview.

4.4 Health & Failure

Health System:
• Continuous HP scale: 0–100.
• Starting HP: 30/100 (player begins injured).
• Display: Health bar UI (top-left) with numeric value and color gradient (Green → Yellow → Red).

Passive Health Drain:
• Simple Mode: Drain rate calibrated for ~6 minutes survival with competent play.
• Advanced Mode: 15% faster than Simple Mode.

Health Restoration:
• Per successful tune cast (within correct timing window): +X HP (subject to balancing).
• Cannot exceed 100 HP cap.

Snake Attack Damage:
• Triggered by:
  1. Tune timing failure (too short or too long).
  2. Collision with active/aggressive snake not put to sleep.
  3. Early release during Tune 3 (Attack).
• Damage amount: Subject to balancing (must allow mistakes without instant lethal).
• Visual feedback: Red flash, screen shake, floating damage text, red particle burst.
• Audio feedback: Hiss, bite impact sound.

Death Condition:
• HP ≤ 0 → immediate game over.
• Lose screen displays stats; session data sent to backend.

UI Feedback – Low Health Warnings:
• At 50% HP: Health bar shifts to yellow.
• At 25% HP: Health bar turns red with pulsing.
• At 10% HP: Red vignette at screen edges with heartbeat audio loop.

4.5 Win & Lose Conditions

Win (both modes):
• Reach the window exit trigger with HP > 0.
• Advanced mode: Bonus rating if 4th tune unlocked and used.

Lose (both modes):
• Health reaches 0.

Advanced Mode Additional Pressure:
• Dynamic collapse timer linked to HP percentage.
• Time remaining = (Current HP / Max HP) × Base Time Multiplier.
• If timer reaches 0: Ruin collapses → lose condition.

====================================================================

5. World, Level & Progression

5.1 Setting & Tone

Setting: Interior of ancient ruined temple or fortress, partially collapsed.
Environment: Stone corridors, broken pillars, fallen debris, dim light shafts.
Tone: Mysterious, slightly tense but not horror. Focus on cleverness and precise control.

5.2 Level Structure

Single handcrafted level reused for both modes with variation through rules (drain rate, timer, aggression, timing difficulty).

Area 1 – Tutorial & First Challenge

• Safe entry zone introducing movement and camera controls.
• Teaches all 3 core tunes with easy, forgiving puzzles.
• Pack of smaller snakes (lower damage output, more patient).
• Player experiments with all 3 tunes to solve low-risk puzzle.
• Timing windows lenient in Simple mode; slightly tighter in Advanced.
• Objective: Learn charm mechanics and timing precision without high threat.
• Exit leads to Area 2.

Area 2 – Escalation

• Combination of blocking and patrolling snakes.
• Requires decisions between Move and Sleep tunes for safe passage.
• Aggressive snake encounter in narrow corridor.
• Optional use of Attack tune to redirect threats.
• Health management becomes critical; fewer mistakes tolerated.
• Hidden alcove (Advanced mode only) containing scroll for Tune 4.
• Timing windows stricter than Area 1; consequences of failure increase.

Area 3 – Finale

• 3+ snakes in layered layout near window.
• Requires combined, skillful usage of all learned tunes.
• Highly visible exit with light beam.
• Final push—health management and precise timing critical for survival.
• Timing windows most strict; snake behaviors most aggressive.

====================================================================

9. Risks & Open Questions

9.1 Design Risks

Teaching cost: 3–4 tunes plus timing-based holding could overwhelm players.
Mitigation: Gentle tutorial ramp, clear timing cue, low-risk early area, forgiving timing windows in Simple mode.

Timing precision balance: Too strict = frustrating; too lenient = trivial.
Mitigation: Extensive playtesting with varied hold durations; separate tuning for Simple vs. Advanced.

Snake sleeping persistence: Snakes remain asleep until player passes or timer resets.
Mitigation: Clear visual feedback when snake sleeps; test duration appropriateness.

Attack command complexity: Early release stops attack, may redirect to player.
Mitigation: Clear visual feedback on snake engagement; debug UI for testing.

9.2 Technical Risks

Timing precision implementation: Hit detection and window validation requires precise input timing.
Mitigation: Implement configurable timing windows; debug mode for verification.

Audio loop management: Variable melody durations (5–12 sec) require flexible audio system.
Mitigation: Pre-record separate audio clips for each tune duration variation or use dynamic audio system.

====================================================================

10. Balancing Framework

10.1 Core Balance Variables

Health Pool: Maximum HP 100, Starting HP 30.

Passive Drain Rates:
• Simple Mode: Drain rate for ~6 minutes survival (subject to playtesting).
• Advanced Mode: 15% faster than Simple.

Tune Timing Windows:
• Simple Mode: Longer hold windows (more forgiving).
• Advanced Mode: Shorter hold windows (more challenging).
• Tune 3 scales dynamically with target distance.
• Tune 4 (Advanced) scales with hold duration for effect size.

Health Restoration:
• Per successful tune cast: +X HP (subject to balancing).
• Only on success (within correct timing window).

Snake Attack Damage:
• Bite damage: Subject to playtesting.
• Must be significant threat without instant lethality.
• Encourages precise timing and careful planning.

10.2 Balancing Approach

Phase 1 (Week 2-3): Initial implementation with placeholder values.
Phase 2 (Week 4): Playtesting and iteration on timing windows and damage.
Phase 3 (Week 5): Polish and lock final values.

10.3 Balance Constraints

All numeric values (drain, restoration, damage, timing windows) must satisfy:
• Timing rewarding: Successful, precise hold-release extends survival.
• Mistake punishing: Timing failures have cost (damage + time loss).
• Mode differentiation: Advanced clearly more demanding.
• Completion viability: 5–8 minutes achievable with skill.

====================================================================
