Project: PIP-3 Theme B – Solo Game Development Project

====================================================================

1. Project Frame

1.1 Academic Context

Theme: B – Eigenständiges 2D- oder 3D-Spiel mit klarer Kernmechanik
Engine: Unity (3D)
Platform: Windows, school laptops, stable 60 FPS, 1920×1080 + ultrawide support
Team: Solo
Duration: 03.02.2026 – ~03.03.2026

Implications of Theme B:
• Focus on one clear core mechanic.
• Deliver a playable, completed prototype with clear win and loss conditions.
• At least one full gameplay loop: Start → Play → End.
• Game/round statistics stored in a database via HTTP/JSON API.
• Structured code and clean project organization.
• Implement one Wahlinhalt: "Verschiedene Modi – mind. 2 Modi" (Simple & Advanced mode).

====================================================================

2. High-Level Concept

2.1 Elevator Pitch

In Snake Enchanter, the player is a wounded warrior trapped in a collapsed ancient ruin, racing against failing health to reach the only escape: a distant window. Unable to fight in their weakened state, the warrior uses discovered magical melodies to command snakes—moving them aside, lulling them to sleep, or redirecting them toward other threats. Each melody requires precise timing: hold the tune key to charge a slider, then release when the marker enters the glowing trigger zone. Release too early and the charm fizzles harmlessly; release too late and the snake strikes back. Time is the enemy—health depletes continuously as the warrior weakens, and in Advanced mode, a dynamic collapse timer adapts to health levels, creating mounting pressure.

2.2 Core Fantasy

The player is a warrior, but not in fighting condition.
Music becomes the weapon when physical strength fails.
The ruins are unstable; snakes are both danger and tool.
Every second counts—the warrior is injured and weakening.
Skillful command—precise slider timing—extends survival; mistakes are costly.

2.3 Target Audience

Age 16+, casual-to-mid-core players, no specific genre experience required.
Should understand goal and controls within 30–60 seconds.

2.4 Project Goals (Theme B Alignment)

• Deliver a clear, understandable core mechanic (slider-based snake command with timing skill).
• Provide a short, replayable experience (5–8 minutes per run).
• Implement two modes (Simple, Advanced) from same core level and systems.
• Integrate database-backed stats to reflect player performance.
• Support a highly readable, trailer-friendly experience.

====================================================================

3. Game Structure

3.1 Game Loop

1. Main Menu → Mode selection (Simple / Advanced).
2. Brief intro (camera + on-screen hints).
3. Core gameplay: move through ruin, charm snakes, manage health depletion.
4. Health management:
   a. Health drains passively over time (wounded warrior).
   b. Successful tune casts restore HP (motivational boost).
   c. Snake attacks deal HP damage.
5. Reach window (win) or health reaches 0 (lose) or (Advanced) dynamic timer expires.
6. Show result screen (stats) + send stats to backend.
7. Option: Restart same mode or return to menu.

3.2 Session Length

Target: 5–8 minutes per run (both modes).
Health drain rates calibrated to this target duration.

3.3 Modes (Wahlinhalt – 2 Modi)

Mode 1 – Simple Escape
• All 3 core tunes available from start.
• Slower passive health drain.
• Snakes slower and less aggressive.
• Wider trigger zones on slider (easier timing).
• No additional timer pressure.
• Objective: Reach the window with HP > 0.

Mode 2 – Advanced Escape
• All 3 core tunes from start.
• Hidden scroll unlocks 4th tune mid-level (optional but rewarded).
• Faster passive health drain (15% faster than Simple).
• Narrower trigger zones on slider (more difficult).
• Dynamic collapse timer linked to HP percentage.
• Snakes patrol faster and react quicker.
• Objective: Reach window before timer expires with HP > 0; bonus for unlocking Tune 4.

====================================================================

4. Core Gameplay & Mechanics

4.1 Player Abilities

Movement: Free 3D movement using WASD.
Camera: First-person view with mouse look.
Interaction: Trigger tune casting when inside "command range" of a target snake.

4.2 Tune System (Kernmechanik) – Genshin-Style Hold & Release Slider

Core Mechanic:
Each tune is mapped to a single key (1, 2, 3, 4 – not Numpad). Player holds the key to charge a slider from 0% to 100%. A colored trigger zone marks the success area. Player must release the key when the slider position is within the trigger zone.

Slider Behavior:
• HOLD KEY: Slider moves continuously from 0% toward 100%.
• RELEASE KEY: Current slider position is evaluated against trigger zone.
• Slider speed determined by tune duration (shorter duration = faster slider).

Three Possible Outcomes:

1. TOO EARLY (Release before trigger zone):
   • Charm fizzles – no effect.
   • Snake returns to idle state.
   • No damage to player (safe fail).
   • Player can retry immediately.

2. SUCCESS (Release within trigger zone):
   • Charm succeeds – snake obeys command.
   • Player health restored (+X HP).
   • Visual/audio confirmation feedback.
   • Snake executes commanded behavior.

3. TOO LATE (Release after trigger zone OR slider reaches 100%):
   • Charm breaks – loss of control.
   • Snake becomes aggressive and attacks.
   • Player takes HP damage.
   • Time is lost (must deal with angry snake).

Tune Parameters:

| Tune | Key | Slider Duration | Trigger Zone | Effect |
|------|-----|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| Move | 1 | 3 seconds | 40-65% | Snake moves away |
| Sleep | 2 | 4 seconds | 35-60% | Snake falls asleep |
| Attack | 3 | 5 seconds | 30-55% | Snake attacks enemy |
| Freeze | 4 | 6 seconds | 25-50% | All creatures freeze |

Mode Difficulty Adjustment:
• Simple Mode: Trigger zones are 10% wider (e.g., Move becomes 35-70%).
• Advanced Mode: Trigger zones as specified above.

Visual Slider Cue:
• Location: Center-bottom of screen or near targeted snake.
• Visual: Horizontal slider bar with moving marker.
• Trigger zone highlighted in green/cyan color.
• Before zone: Gray/neutral color.
• After zone: Red color (danger).
• Marker shows current position as key is held.

Audio Feedback:
• Melody plays continuously during hold, rising in pitch/intensity.
• Success: Melody resolves with uplifting chime + snake responds.
• Too Early: Melody fades out softly (no harsh sound).
• Too Late: Melody distorts with warning tone, snake hisses.

====================================================================

5. World, Level & Progression

5.1 Setting & Tone

Setting: Interior of ancient ruined temple or cave system, partially collapsed.
Environment: Stone corridors, broken pillars, fallen debris, dim light shafts.
Tone: Mysterious, slightly tense but not horror. Focus on cleverness and precise control.

5.2 Level Structure

Single handcrafted level reused for both modes with variation through rules (drain rate, timer, aggression, trigger zone width).

Area 1 – Tutorial & First Challenge

• Safe entry zone introducing movement and camera controls.
• Teaches all 3 core tunes with easy, forgiving puzzles.
• Pack of smaller snakes (lower damage output, more patient).
• Player experiments with slider timing on low-risk encounters.
• Trigger zones widest here (Tutorial: 35-75% for all tunes).
• Objective: Learn slider mechanics and timing precision without high threat.
• Exit leads to Area 2.

Area 2 – Escalation

• Combination of blocking and patrolling snakes.
• Requires decisions between Move and Sleep tunes for safe passage.
• Aggressive snake encounter in narrow corridor.
• Optional use of Attack tune to redirect threats.
• Health management becomes critical; fewer mistakes tolerated.
• Hidden alcove (Advanced mode only) containing scroll for Tune 4.
• Trigger zones tighter than Area 1; consequences of failure increase.

Area 3 – Finale

• 3+ snakes in layered layout near window.
• Requires combined, skillful usage of all learned tunes.
• Highly visible exit with light beam.
• Final push—health management and precise slider timing critical.
• Trigger zones tightest here; snake behaviors most aggressive.

====================================================================

====================================================================

9. Risks & Open Questions

9.1 Design Risks

Teaching cost: Slider mechanic plus 3–4 tunes could overwhelm players.
Mitigation: Gentle tutorial ramp, clear visual slider, wide trigger zones in tutorial area.

Trigger zone balance: Too narrow = frustrating; too wide = trivial.
Mitigation: Extensive playtesting; mode differentiation (Simple wider, Advanced narrower).

"Too Early" being too safe: Players might always release early to avoid damage.
Mitigation: No HP restoration on too-early release; must succeed to progress and heal.

Snake sleeping persistence: Snakes remain asleep until player passes.
Mitigation: Clear visual feedback when snake sleeps; test duration appropriateness.

9.2 Technical Risks

Slider precision: Input timing and visual sync must be accurate.
Mitigation: Use Time.deltaTime for smooth slider movement; test on target hardware.

Audio sync: Melody must match slider duration exactly.
Mitigation: Pre-record audio clips matching each tune's slider duration (3s, 4s, 5s, 6s).

====================================================================

10. Balancing Framework

10.1 Core Balance Variables

Health Pool: Maximum HP 100, Starting HP 30.

Passive Drain Rates:
• Simple Mode: Drain rate for ~6 minutes survival (subject to playtesting).
• Advanced Mode: 15% faster than Simple.

Trigger Zone Sizes by Context:

| Context | Zone Width | Example (Move Tune) |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| Tutorial | 40% | 30-70% |
| Simple Mode | 35% | 35-70% |
| Advanced Mode | 25% | 40-65% |
| Elite Snake | 15% | 42-57% |

Health Restoration:
• Per successful tune cast: +X HP (subject to balancing).
• Only on success (release within trigger zone).

Snake Attack Damage:
• Bite damage: Subject to playtesting.
• Must be significant threat without instant lethality.
• Only triggered on "too late" releases, not "too early".

10.2 Balancing Approach

Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Initial implementation with placeholder values.
Phase 2 (Week 3): Playtesting and iteration on trigger zones and damage.
Phase 3 (Week 4): Polish and lock final values.

10.3 Balance Constraints

All numeric values must satisfy:
• Slider rewarding: Successful release within zone extends survival.
• Risk/reward clear: Too early = safe but no progress; too late = punishment.
• Mode differentiation: Advanced clearly more demanding (narrower zones).
• Completion viability: 5–8 minutes achievable with skill.

====================================================================
