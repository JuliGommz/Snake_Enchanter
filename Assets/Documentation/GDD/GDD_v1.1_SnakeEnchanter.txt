Snake Enchanter – GDD v1.1
Version: 1.1 – Updated 27.01.2026 11:53 CET
This document evolves during development. Sections marked [MAY CHANGE] are expected to be refined or adapted.
[MAJOR UPDATE v1.1: Health system completely revised - see Section 4.3]

====================================================================

1. Project Frame

1.1 Academic Context

Theme: B – Eigenständiges 2D- oder 3D-Spiel mit klarer Kernmechanik

Engine: Unity (3D)

Platform: Windows, school laptops, stable 60 FPS, 1920×1080 + ultrawide support

Team: Solo

Duration: 21.01.2026 – 27.02.2026

Implications of Theme B:
• Focus on one clear core mechanic (no feature soup).
• Deliver a playable, completed prototype with clear win and loss conditions.
• At least one full gameplay loop: Start → Play → End.
• Game/round statistics stored in a database via HTTP/JSON API.
• Structured code and clean project organization expected and graded.
• Implement one Wahlinhalt: here: "Verschiedene Modi – mind. 2 Modi" (Simple & Advanced mode).

====================================================================

2. High-Level Concept

2.1 Elevator Pitch

In Snake Enchanter, the player is a wounded adventurer trapped in a collapsed ancient ruin, racing against their own failing health to escape. Using magical melodies played through simple button-holds, the player commands snakes to move, sleep, or attack other enemies, opening a path to the only exit: a distant window. Each successful tune restores a small amount of health, rewarding skillful play, while mistakes provoke vicious bites that drain life rapidly. Time is the enemy—health depletes continuously as the player weakens, and in Advanced mode, a dynamic collapse timer adapts to health levels, creating mounting pressure.

2.2 Core Fantasy

You are not a warrior; your power is music.

The ruins are unstable; snakes are both danger and tool.

You are injured and weakening—every second counts.

Skillful charm extends your survival; mistakes are costly.

2.3 Target Audience

Age 16+, casual-to-mid-core players, no specific genre experience required.

Should understand goal and controls within 30–60 seconds.

2.4 Project Goals (Theme B Alignment)

• Deliver a clear, understandable core mechanic (snake command via melodies).
• Provide a short, replayable experience (5–8 minutes per run).
• Implement two modes (Simple, Advanced) from same core level and systems.
• Integrate database-backed stats to reflect player performance across runs.
• Support a highly readable, trailer-friendly experience for presentation and Gamescom context.

====================================================================

3. Game Structure

3.1 Game Loop

Global loop:
1. Main Menu → Mode selection (Simple / Advanced).
2. Brief intro (camera + on-screen hints).
3. Core gameplay: move through ruin, charm snakes, manage health depletion.
4. Health management:
   a. Health drains passively over time (wounded MC)
   b. Successful tune casts restore +5 HP (motivational boost)
   c. Snake attacks deal -25 HP damage
5. Reach window (win) or health reaches 0 (lose) or (Advanced) dynamic timer expires.
6. Show result screen (stats) + send stats to backend.
7. Option: Restart same mode or return to menu.

3.2 Session Length

Target: 5–8 minutes per run (both modes).

Balanced to allow several attempts in a classroom session.

Health drain rates calibrated to this target duration.

3.3 Modes (Wahlinhalt – 2 Modi)

Mode 1 – Simple Escape

• All 3 core tunes available from start.
• Slower passive health drain (~0.83 HP/second).
• Snakes slower and less aggressive.
• No additional timer pressure.
• Objective: Reach the window with HP > 0.

Mode 2 – Advanced Escape

• All 3 core tunes from start.
• Hidden scroll unlocks 4th tune mid-level (optional but rewarded).
• Faster passive health drain (~0.95 HP/second, 15% faster than Simple).
• Dynamic collapse timer linked to HP percentage (more health = more time).
• Snakes patrol faster and react quicker.
• Objective:
  - Base: Reach the window before timer expires and with HP > 0.
  - Bonus: Unlock 4th tune and use it at least once (for higher score/achievement).

[MAY CHANGE]
Exact drain rates, timer formula, and aggression values will be tuned during playtesting.
4th tune effect may be simplified or changed if too complex to communicate.

====================================================================

4. Core Gameplay & Mechanics

4.1 Player Abilities

Movement:
• Free 3D movement using WASD.
• Mouse controls camera orientation (third-person follow camera).

View:
• Third-person follow camera behind/above the character.

Interaction:
• Trigger tune casting when inside a defined "command range" of a target snake.
• Simple interaction prompts (e.g., "Hold 1 to cast Move Tune").

4.2 Tune System (Kernmechanik)

Concept:
Each tune is mapped to a single key; holding the key for ~1 second plays a short melody and triggers a specific snake behavior, if the snake is in range and receptive.

[NEW v1.1] Health Restoration Mechanic:
• Each successful tune cast restores +5 HP (subject to balancing, may increase to +10 HP).
• Encourages active engagement over passive waiting.
• Balances passive health drain.
• Provides positive feedback loop for skilled players.
• Visual feedback: small green glow/particles on player, "+5" floating text.
• Audio feedback: uplifting chime.

Tunes (Mode 1 & 2):

Tune 1 – Move Command
• Input: Hold Key 1.
• Effect: Targeted snake moves to a predefined safe position (e.g., away from path).
• Primary use: Clear blocking snakes to open passage.
• On success: Snake moves smoothly, +5 HP restored to player.

Tune 2 – Sleep Command
• Input: Hold Key 2.
• Effect: Snake coils up, becomes passive, collision reduced or removed so player can pass.
• Primary use: Make aggressive snakes safe to walk past.
• On success: Snake sleeps peacefully, +5 HP restored to player.

Tune 3 – Attack Command
• Input: Hold Key 3.
• Effect: Target snake lunges at the nearest other snake, potentially removing both as threats.
• Primary use: Manage groups of snakes without passing through them.
• On success: Snake attacks target, +5 HP restored to player.

Advanced Mode – Additional Tune:

Tune 4 – [Working Name: "Freeze All"] [MAY CHANGE]
• Input: Hold Key 4 (unlocked by scroll).
• Effect: Temporarily freezes all snakes in a radius (stops movement, disables attacks).
• Primary use: High-impact panic button in advanced puzzles.
• On success: All nearby snakes freeze, +5 HP restored to player.

Failure Feedback:

If the wrong tune is used on a snake (or used in the wrong context):
• Snake plays aggressive animation and executes bite attack.
• Player takes -25 HP instant damage.
• Visual feedback: red flash, screen shake, "-25" floating damage text, red particle burst.
• Audio feedback: sharp hiss, impact sound, optional pain voice clip.

[MAY CHANGE]
Exact mapping of tunes to effects and required snake states may be simplified further if teaching cost is too high in early playtests.
Restoration amount (+5 HP vs +10 HP) subject to Week 4 balancing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3 Health & Failure [MAJOR UPDATE v1.1]

[NEW v1.1] Health System Overview:

The player character is wounded and attempting to escape. Health is a continuous value that depletes over time, representing the character's weakening condition. Successful snake charming provides brief respites (health restoration), while snake attacks and passive drain create constant pressure.

Health Value:
• Continuous HP value: 0–100 (floating-point).
• Starting HP: 30/100 (player begins injured).
• Display: Health bar UI with numeric value (e.g., "30/100").
• Color gradient: Green (healthy) → Yellow (wounded) → Red (critical).

Passive Health Drain:

Health decreases continuously during gameplay, representing the wounded MC weakening over time.

Simple Mode:
• Drain rate: ~0.83 HP/second.
• Allows approximately 6 minutes of survival time with perfect play (30 HP ÷ 0.083 + restoration).

Advanced Mode:
• Drain rate: ~0.95 HP/second (15% faster than Simple).
• Creates urgency; approximately 5 minutes target completion time.

[MAY CHANGE] Exact drain rates will be tuned during Week 4 playtesting to achieve desired difficulty curve.

Health Restoration (Motivational Boost):

+5 HP per successful tune cast:
• Triggers when player correctly charms a snake with appropriate tune.
• Visual: small green particle burst, "+5" floating text.
• Audio: positive chime.
• Purpose: Rewards skillful play, extends survival time, creates skill-based time extension.

Optional checkpoint bonuses:
• +15 HP when clearing major area/checkpoint (if implemented).
• Provides milestones and pacing for longer sections.

Maximum HP cap:
• Player cannot exceed 100 HP through restoration.

[MAY CHANGE] Restoration amount may increase to +10 HP if playtesting shows +5 is insufficient to balance drain.

Snake Attack Damage:

Bite Attack (Primary): -25 HP instant damage
• Triggered by:
  1. Using wrong tune on a snake.
  2. Collision with aggressive or patrolling snake.
• Animation: Snake lunge/bite (supported by Toon Snakes Pack asset).
• Visual feedback: red flash, screen shake, "-25" floating damage text, red particle burst from impact.
• Audio feedback: hiss, bite impact sound, optional player pain sound.

Poisonous Fog Attack (Optional): -5 HP/second continuous damage
• Status: NOT included in Toon Snakes Pack; requires custom Unity Particle System + trigger collider.
• Implementation: Area-of-effect fog zone with continuous damage while player remains inside.
• Visual: green/purple particle fog with poison VFX.
• Priority: OPTIONAL—implement only if time permits after core systems (Week 4+).

[MAY CHANGE] Bite damage value (-25 HP) subject to balancing. Poison fog may be postponed or cut if time constraints.

Death Condition:

• HP ≤ 0 → immediate game over.
• Triggers lose screen with stats.
• Session data sent to backend.

UI Feedback – Low Health Warnings:

• At 50% HP (50/100): Health bar shifts to yellow.
• At 25% HP (25/100): Health bar turns red + pulsing effect.
• At 10% HP (10/100): Red vignette appears at screen edges + heartbeat audio loop.

Purpose: Clear communication of danger state without obscuring gameplay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4 Win & Lose Conditions

Win (both modes):
• Reach the window exit trigger with HP > 0.
• Advanced mode: Bonus rating/score if 4th tune unlocked and used.

Lose (both modes):
• Health reaches 0 (from passive drain + snake attacks).

Advanced Mode Additional Pressure:
• Dynamic collapse timer linked to HP percentage.
• Formula: Time remaining = (Current HP / Max HP) × Base Time Multiplier.
• Example scaling:
  - At 100 HP: Full time buffer (e.g., 10 minutes).
  - At 50 HP: Half buffer (5 minutes).
  - At 10 HP: Critical timer (1 minute).
• Creates escalating tension as health depletes.
• If timer reaches 0: ruin collapses → lose condition.

[MAY CHANGE] Advanced mode timer formula and base multiplier subject to balancing. Alternative simpler approach: remove separate timer, rely solely on 15% faster drain.

====================================================================

5. World, Level & Progression

5.1 Setting & Tone

Setting:
• Interior of an ancient ruined temple or fortress, partially collapsed.
• Environment: stone corridors, broken pillars, fallen debris, dim light shafts from above.

Tone:
• Mysterious, slightly tense but not horror.
• Focus on cleverness and control rather than panic.
• Narrative emphasis: wounded protagonist racing against failing health.

5.2 Level Structure

Single handcrafted level reused for both modes, with variation through rules (drain rate, timer, aggression, optional tune).

Rough Area Flow:

Start Area – Tutorial
• Safe entry zone.
• Introduces movement and camera.
• Teaches tune 1 (Move) with a simple, low-risk puzzle.
• Low snake threat; player can experiment safely.

Area 1 – Simple Blockade
• 1–2 snakes blocking the path.
• Player uses Move or Sleep tunes to clear path.
• First opportunity to practice health restoration mechanic.

Area 2 – Mixed Behavior
• Combination of blocking and patrolling snakes.
• Requires decisions between Move and Sleep.
• Maybe one optional use of Attack to remove extra risk.
• Health management becomes relevant.

Area 3 – Aggressive Encounter
• An aggressive snake patrolling a narrow corridor.
• Encourages use of Sleep or Attack tunes under pressure.
• Mistakes costly (-25 HP); rewards careful play.

Area 4 – Hidden Alcove (Advanced Only)
• Optional side path containing scroll unlocking Tune 4.
• Accessible only if player solves a small positioning puzzle.
• Risk vs. reward: extra time/health spent for powerful tool.

Area 5 – Finale
• 3+ snakes in a layered layout near the window.
• Intended to require combined usage of all tunes.
• Highly visible exit with light beam.
• Final push—health management critical.

[MAY CHANGE]
Number of areas and specific snake placements will be refined during level iteration.
Advanced mode might adjust snake layouts slightly if necessary.
Checkpoint healing (+15 HP) may be added between areas if playtesting shows excessive difficulty.

====================================================================

====================================================================

9. Risks & Open Questions

9.1 Design Risks

Teaching cost:
• 3–4 tunes plus health drain/restoration and mode differences could overwhelm players.
• Mitigation: Very gentle tutorial ramp, clear on-screen prompts, low-risk early areas.

Complexity of snake behaviors:
• Multi-state snakes (idle, blocking, patrolling, aggressive, charmed) can be complex to debug.
• Mitigation: Start with minimal states and build up only if needed.

[NEW v1.1] Passive drain feeling oppressive:
• Continuous HP loss may frustrate rather than motivate players.
• Mitigation: Generous +5 HP restoration every ~15-30 seconds with good play; drain rates calibrated to allow skilled completion with HP to spare (target: 40–60 HP remaining on win).

[NEW v1.1] Balancing drain + restoration + attack damage:
• Three-variable balance equation is complex and fragile.
• Mitigation: Extensive playtesting Week 4, all values configurable via inspector, implement debug UI for real-time adjustment.

9.2 Open Questions / [MAY CHANGE]

Should some tunes only work on specific snake types (e.g., Attack only on aggressive snakes)?

Should 4th tune be mandatory for Advanced win, or only a bonus?

Do we need additional environmental hazards to create more variety, or are snakes alone enough?

[NEW v1.1] Should restoration amount be +5 HP or +10 HP?
• Depends on drain rate tuning and desired difficulty.
• To be decided during Week 4 balancing.

[NEW v1.1] Should Advanced mode use dynamic HP-linked timer or just rely on faster drain?
• Dynamic timer: More complex, greater tension escalation.
• Faster drain only: Simpler to implement and communicate.
• To be decided before GDD v2.0 (Feb 11 deadline).

[NEW v1.1] Should poison fog be implemented, or focus solely on bite attacks?
• Poison fog requires custom particle system + scripting (not in Toon Snakes Pack).
• Recommendation: Implement bite attacks first (Week 3), add fog only if time permits (Week 4+).

These will be answered during early playtests and GDD v2.0 iteration.

====================================================================
