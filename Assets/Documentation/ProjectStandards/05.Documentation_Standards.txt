# Documentation & Attribution Standards

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Academic documentation and attribution compliance  
**Application**: After implementation, before submission  
**Dependencies**: References CODE_DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md for implementation context

## 🎓 ACADEMIC ATTRIBUTION SYSTEM

### Three-Tier Classification

**Mandatory**: Every new code file MUST contain attribution header

**Classification Categories**:
```
[HUMAN-AUTHORED]
  → Developer wrote code independently
  → No AI assistance in implementation
  → Original problem-solving

[AI-ASSISTED]
  → Collaborative development
  → Human provides direction/architecture
  → AI assists with implementation details
  → Human validates and modifies output

[AI-GENERATED]
  → AI wrote initial implementation
  → Human provided requirements/specifications
  → Human reviewed and approved
  → May include human modifications
```

### Attribution Guidelines

**What to Document**:
```
✓ Who wrote initial implementation
✓ Who provided design/architecture decisions
✓ What AI assistance was used
✓ What human validation/modification occurred
✓ Key dependencies and requirements
```

**Be Specific**:
```
✓ GOOD: 
  [HUMAN-AUTHORED]
  - Component-First architecture design
  - Service Locator pattern selection
  - Error handling strategy
  
  [AI-ASSISTED]
  - Initial ServiceLocator implementation
  - Thread-safety improvements suggested by AI
  - Human validated and modified error handling

✗ VAGUE:
  [HUMAN-AUTHORED]
  - Some code
  
  [AI-ASSISTED]
  - AI helped
```

## 📝 INLINE DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Function/Method Documentation

**Required for All Public Methods**:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates damage based on attack power and target defense
/// </summary>
/// <param name="attackPower">Attacker's strength value</param>
/// <param name="defense">Target's defense rating</param>
/// <returns>Final damage amount after calculations</returns>
public int CalculateDamage(int attackPower, int defense)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

**JavaScript JSDoc**:
```javascript
/**
 * Filters projects by pillar category
 * @param {string} pillar - Pillar category ('human', 'learning', 'ai', or 'all')
 * @param {HTMLElement} btn - Button element that triggered filter
 * @returns {void}
 */
function filterProjects(pillar, btn) {
    // Implementation
}
```

---

### Comment Best Practices

**Explain WHY, Not WHAT**:
```csharp
// ✓ GOOD: Explain reasoning
// Using Awake instead of Start to ensure initialization before other scripts
void Awake() { ... }

// ✗ BAD: State obvious
// This is the Awake method
void Awake() { ... }
```

**Document Complex Logic**:
```javascript
// ✓ GOOD: Clarify algorithm
// Fisher-Yates shuffle for unbiased randomization
// Iterates backwards to avoid reprocessing elements
for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) { ... }

// ✗ BAD: Don't comment self-explanatory code
// Loop through array
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { ... }
```

**Mark Technical Debt**:
```csharp
// TODO: Refactor to use object pooling for performance
// Current instantiation method causes GC spikes
Instantiate(projectilePrefab);

// FIXME: Edge case bug when health exactly equals zero
// Need to handle simultaneous death triggers
if (health <= 0) { ... }

// HACK: Temporary workaround for Unity 2022 serialization bug
// Remove when Unity fixes issue in 2023.1+
[SerializeField, HideInInspector]
private int workaroundValue;
```

## 🚫 DOCUMENTATION ANTI-PATTERNS

### Never Do This

**Don't Delete Attribution Headers**:
```
❌ Removing academic headers to "clean up" code
❌ Deleting authorship classification
❌ Removing dependency documentation
```

**Reason**: Academic integrity violation, evaluation requirement

**Don't Leave Dead Code**:
```
❌ Commented-out old implementations
❌ Unused imports/using statements
❌ Empty or placeholder comments
```

**Don't Write Misleading Comments**:
```
❌ Comments that don't match code
❌ Outdated documentation after refactoring
❌ Copy-pasted comments from elsewhere
```

**Don't Over-Document**:
```
❌ Commenting every line (noise)
❌ Repeating what code obviously does
❌ Documenting trivial getters/setters
```
