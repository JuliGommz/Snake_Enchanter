## 1. Administrative Frame

- **School / Module:** SRH Fachschulen – Praxisprojekte IT & Medien (PIP-3) [file:1]
- **Theme:** **Thema B – Eigenständiges 2D- oder 3D-Spiel mit klarer Kernmechanik** [file:1]
- **Student:** Julian
- **Team:** Solo (Einzelarbeit) [file:1]
- **Project Title:** *Snake Enchanter – Ruin Escape*
- **Project Period:** 21.01.2026 – 27.02.2026 [file:1]
- **Working Time:** According to timetable PIP-GME24, Mo–Fr, 8:30–15:30 [file:1]

### 1.1 Theme B – Implications

From the PIP-3 brief: [file:1]

- Focus on **one clear core mechanic** (gameplay & feel, not content size).
- Deliver a **playable, closed prototype** (Start → Play → End).
- Must have **clear win and loss conditions** and understandable rules.
- Implementation as **2D or 3D game in Unity**.
- **Store game/round statistics** in a database, via **HTTP + JSON** API.
- Code must be **structured and clean** (project organization is graded).
- Implement at least **one Wahlinhalt**:
  - Chosen: **„Verschiedene Level oder Modi – mind. 3 Level bzw. 2 Modi“** → fulfilled via **2 modes**. [file:1]

---

## 2. High-Level Concept

### 2.1 Elevator Pitch

> The player is an adventurer trapped inside a collapsed ancient ruin. Venomous snakes block the only escape – a distant window. By playing magical melodies via simple button-hold inputs, the player commands snakes to move, sleep, or attack each other, opening a safe path. Wrong tunes provoke attacks and cost hearts. Two modes (Simple and Advanced) offer increasing challenge using the same level.

### 2.2 Core Fantasy & Theme

- Player fantasy: **musical snake charmer / adventurer**, not a fighter.
- Environment: **ancient ruins**, partially collapsed, with visible exit window.
- Central tension: **“Do I dare cast this tune on this snake here, now?”**
- Tone: mysterious, tense, but not horror; readability and clarity over gore.

### 2.3 Target Audience

- **USK 16** orientation, but broadly accessible. [file:1]
- No genre-specific prior knowledge required (simple, teachable control scheme). [file:1]
- Typical session: **5–8 minutes** per run.

---

## 3. Game Structure

### 3.1 Modes (Wahlinhalt)

Chosen Wahlinhalt: **„Verschiedene Level oder Modi – mind. 3 Level bzw. 2 Modi“ → 2 modes.** [file:1]

- **Mode 1 – Simple Escape**
  - All 3 core tunes available from start.
  - No global timer.
  - Snakes move and attack more slowly.
  - Objective: Reach window exit with ≥1 heart.

- **Mode 2 – Advanced Escape**
  - Start with same 3 core tunes.
  - Hidden scroll mid-level unlocks **4th tune** (optional, higher reward).
  - Global collapse timer (approx. 8 minutes) **[MAY CHANGE]**.
  - Snakes patrol faster, react quicker to mistakes.
  - Objective:
    - Base: Reach window exit before time runs out with ≥1 heart.
    - Bonus: Discover and use the 4th tune at least once (extra stats/score).

> Design Note: Exact timer value, snake speeds, and 4th tune behavior may change during balancing. **[MAY CHANGE]**

### 3.2 Core Loop

Per session (run):

1. Main menu → choose **Simple** or **Advanced**.
2. Short intro: camera shows trapped adventurer and distant window.
3. Player explores ruins, encounters snakes blocking passages.
4. Player uses **tunes** to command snakes:
   - **Correct tune:** snake obeys (move/sleep/attack other).
   - **Wrong tune:** snake counter-attacks → lose 1 heart.
5. Player navigates multiple “puzzle pockets” of snakes.
6. Run ends when:
   - Window exit reached (success), OR
   - Hearts reach 0 (death), OR
   - Timer hits 0 in Advanced (collapse).
7. End screen shows stats → stats sent to backend via HTTP/JSON.

---

## 4. Core Mechanics

### 4.1 Player Abilities

- **Movement:**
  - Free 3D movement using **WASD**.
  - **Mouse** controls camera orientation.
- **Camera:**
  - **First-person** camera (mouse look).
  - Camera attached to player at eye height.
- **Interaction Radius:**
  - Tunes only affect snakes within a defined range and line-of-sight **[MAY CHANGE]**.

### 4.2 Tune System (Kernmechanik)

Simplified “rhythm” as **button-hold melodies** (no full rhythm detection).

- **Input model:**
  - Tune 1: Hold `1` for ~1 second.
  - Tune 2: Hold `2` for ~1 second.
  - Tune 3: Hold `3` for ~1 second.
  - Tune 4 (Advanced): Hold `4` for ~1 second (unlocked by scroll).

- **Tune Effects (planned):**
  - **Tune 1 – Move Command**
    - Target snake moves to a safe target position (no longer blocking path).
  - **Tune 2 – Sleep Command**
    - Snake coils up, becomes passive, collision reduced/removed so player can pass.
  - **Tune 3 – Attack Command**
    - Snake lunges at nearest other snake; may remove both from play.
  - **Tune 4 – „Freeze All“ (working name)** **[MAY CHANGE]**
    - Temporarily freezes all snakes in an area (no movement/attacks).

- **Failure Handling:**
  - Wrong tune on a snake, or tune in wrong context:
    - Snake plays “angry” animation, attacks, player loses 1 heart.
    - Visual feedback: red flash, aggressive animation, distinctive SFX.

> Design Note: Exact mapping of tunes to snake types/states may be simplified further for clarity. **[MAY CHANGE]**

### 4.3 Health & Failure

- **Hearts/Lives:**  
  - Player has **3 hearts**.
  - 1 hit (snake bite or relevant hazard) = lose 1 heart.
  - At 0 hearts: immediate death → fail state.

- **Damage Sources:**
  - Wrong tune used on snake.
  - Contact with aggressive snakes.
  - Optional: falling debris / environmental damage **[MAY CHANGE]**.

### 4.4 Win / Lose Conditions

- **Win (both modes):**
  - Reach **window exit** trigger with ≥1 heart.

- **Lose:**
  - Hearts reach 0 in any mode.
  - Advanced mode: global timer reaches 0 (ruin collapses).

## 5. World & Level Design

### 5.1 Setting

- Environment: **interior of ancient stone ruin/temple**, partially collapsed.
- Visual motifs:
  - Broken pillars, collapsed walls, rubble piles.
  - Narrow corridors opening into small chambers.
  - Light shafts from above, strong light at window exit.

### 5.2 Level Structure

Single handcrafted level used by both modes (rules & parameters differ).

Rough progression:

1. **Start Area – Safe & Tutorial**
   - Learn movement and camera.
   - First snake with low risk introduces **Move** tune.

2. **Area 1 – Basic Blockade**
   - One or two snakes blocking linear path.
   - Use Move or Sleep to pass.

3. **Area 2 – Mixed Threats**
   - Combination of blocking and patrolling snakes.
   - Encourages choosing between Move/Sleep, optionally Attack.

4. **Area 3 – Aggressive Corridor**
   - Aggressive snake patrolling narrow hallway.
   - Timing + proper tune usage required.

5. **Area 4 – Hidden Alcove (Advanced Only)**
   - Side path with mild puzzle; reward: scroll unlocking **Tune 4**.
   - Optional for Simple Mode (may be closed off entirely) **[MAY CHANGE]**.

6. **Area 5 – Finale by the Window**
   - More complex arrangement of 3+ snakes.
   - Requires combination of previously learned tunes.
   - Strong visual of exit window with bright light.

> Concrete positions, counts and puzzles will be defined and iterated in level blockout and reflected in GDD v2. **[MAY CHANGE]**

  - Failure: red flash, threatening animation, hiss SFX.

- **End Screen:**
  - Display:
    - Mode
    - Success/failure
    - Completion time
    - Number of snakes successfully commanded (or objectives count)
    - Hearts remaining

- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub; clean commit history is graded. [file:1]
- **Trailer:** MP4, at least 1920×1080. [file:1]

### 7.2 Database & API

Theme-wide mandatory requirements: database + HTTP/JSON + CRUD. [file:1]

**Stats per session (game run):**

- `sessionId` – UUID
- `completionTime` – int (seconds)
- `objectivesCompleted` – int (e.g., snakes successfully commanded / required events)
- `attempts` – int (cumulative attempts for this player/session)

**Planned API endpoints:**

- `POST /api/game-session`  
  - Purpose: store stats after each run.
- `GET /api/leaderboard?mode=simple`  
  - Purpose: retrieve top Simple-mode sessions.
- `GET /api/leaderboard?mode=advanced`  
  - Purpose: retrieve top Advanced-mode sessions.
- `GET /api/player-stats`  
  - Purpose: get aggregate stats for display.

> Endpoint naming and exact parameters may be adjusted based on backend environment and teacher expectations. **[MAY CHANGE]**

## 8. Assets & Media

### 8.1 Visual Assets

- **Snakes:**  
  - Toon Snakes Pack (Unity Asset Store) – 3D animated snakes used as all snake entities.

- **Environment:**  
  - Ruin/temple assets (low-poly), or ProBuilder blockout with stone materials.
  - Props: pillars, rubble, broken walls.

- **Player:**  
  - Simple adventurer character with basic movement animations.
  - Early prototype may use capsule placeholder.

> Exact environment packs and player model may change depending on performance, budget, and time. **[MAY CHANGE]**

### 8.2 Audio

- **Music:**
  - Ambient ruin background track(s), likely generated with Suno.ai or similar, license-checked. [file:1]
  - Optional tension layer activated in Advanced mode as timer runs low.

- **Sound Effects:**
  - 3–4 distinct flute melodies (one per tune).
  - Snake hiss and attack sounds.
  - Environmental ambience (dripping water, distant rumble).
  - UI feedback (success/fail, clicks).

- All music and SFX must be **license-free or appropriately licensed** and **credited in documentation**. [file:1]

## 10. Change Log & Open Points

### 10.1 Major Decisions (Already Changed Once)

- Perspective: from initial **2D side-view** → **3D first-person** (to leverage Toon Snakes Pack and better spatial puzzle).
- Visual style: from **pixel art** → **low-poly 3D**.  
- Mechanic: from potential full rhythm game → simplified **button-hold tune commands**.

These are now considered **locked** unless severe feasibility issues appear.

### 10.2 Expected Change Areas

Marked **[MAY CHANGE]** above; main categories:

- Exact tune effects and where they are allowed.
- Exact snake types and state machine complexity.
- Detailed level layout (number/size of areas, snake counts).
- Timer duration and pacing of Advanced mode.
- Additional environmental hazards (if any).
- API endpoint naming and extended stats.

Any significant change should be reflected here and in GDD v2.

## 11. Next Steps (For Any Future Session / Model)

When resuming work (with Perplexity, Claude, or others):

1. **Load this file** and the current GDD version.
2. Start by:
   - Checking which milestone is upcoming (from §9.1).
   - Verifying current implementation state against this config.
3. Focus initial assistance on:
   - Unity setup & first-person controller (if not done).
   - Core tune → snake reaction prototype.
   - GDD updates for the next submission.
4. Keep this config file as **stable reference**, updating only when major design or requirement changes are decided.
